## Description

This custom module replaces the original 'Clippings Cart' module.
The design concept for the enhanced clippings cart is shown in the following diagram:
<p align="center"><img src="resources/docu/ClippingsCartEnhanced.png" alt="new concept for enhanced clippings cart" align="center" width="100%"></p>

Various functions can collect records in the clippings cart and these records could then be passed on to various evaluation / export / visualization functions.
The user of the module can decide which records should be sent to the clippings cart
and which action should be executed on these records.

As input functions there are
* the functions of the current module "clippings cart" or the existing custom [Vesta clippings cart](https://github.com/vesta-webtrees-2-custom-modules/vesta_clippings_cart) module, which offer the possibility to place objects in the clippings cart for a person or another object (for example a person and their ancestors or descendants, possibly with their families, or all persons with reference to a place)
* the search in the control panel for unconnected persons in a tree (with a new button "send to clippings cart") (tbd)
* the normal webtrees search (also with a button "send to clippings cart"), so that you can search for anything you want and with the option of using all the filter functions that are currently offered (tbd)
* the list display modules "Families" and "Family branches", so that you can send all persons with the same family name or all persons from a clan to the clippings cart (tbd)
* new functions in this module searching for marriage chains or ancestor circles in the tree.

The user can then delete selected records or groups of records of the same type
in the clippings cart or delete the clippings cart completely.

An action initiated by the user then takes place on the records in the clippings cart, such as
* the export to a GEDCOM zip file, as in the actual clippings cart module
* the display of the objects in list form with the possibility of sorting and filtering this list (tbd)
* the transfer of the records in the clippings cart to new functions that visualize this data or analyze it statistically.
Such a function could be for example [TAM](https://github.com/rpreiner/tam) (Topographic Attribute Map) or [Lineage](https://github.com/huhwt/lineage).
